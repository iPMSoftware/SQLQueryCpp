# SQLQueryCpp

This project is somehow fork of SQLQuery chapter in CppFunAndLearn.

Recently I've started to learn some SQL during breakfest and I thought that part of my study would be writing code in C++ for generating SQL queries in a "natural" way. It means, to be as accurate as possible with sql gramma.

I've decided to write this project in TDD way using GTest. In this way I can practice four things:

* C++
* SQL
* TDD
* GTest utilization

When I will be happy with its status, then I will try to write something similar in Goolang.
